# BlobGame
 A small fanmade game inspired by SUIKA.
This was hacked together in a few hours over a couple of days. Don't expect the cleanest of code (for now).

## Changelog

## Known Bugs
- Sometimes clicking doesn't spawn the fruit.

## TODO:
- Pack sprites into a texture atlas.
- Pack resources into a combined resource file.
- The smallest two Blobs allow for three Blobs to be combined into one if the simultaneously collide.
- Add a main menu
- Add a custom physics engine (maybe)
- Resource unloading on scene switch (might not be necessary, since the files are so small and there aren't that many)
- Feature: holding a blob
- Feature: shoving the arena
- Feature: alternate startup mode to run multiple game sims and interaction with sockets

Inspired by SUIKA for the game, and Melba Toast for the theme.
