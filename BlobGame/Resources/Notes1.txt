BUGS:
Sometimes clicking doesnt spawn fruit
z order changes wrongly when blobs are combined
make that items are only added to the audio action queue once
get game to play like the original


TODO:
tutorial
scene unloading
clean all references of melba in the files and code to make it generic for multiple themes

NICE TO HAVE:
change display settings without restarting => needs gui bounds update
random rotations on spawn
custom physics engine?
apparently cherries and strawberries combine into one when 3 of them collide at once?!
maybe score sync with other players? export as base94 string?

Banana: Strange shaped fruit that combines into a peach (or whatever fruit we change peaches to) when it touches another banana.

Jam: A garbage fruit. The only way to get rid of it is to break the jar on the floor or with another jar. (or maybe a toast slice without jam?)

Egg: Breaks when it hits walls or the floor, but combines with itself into an omelette that acts as a mid stage fruit (like a toast slice).

Anyway, these 'fruits' can be put in another game mode, or maybe we have a "Classic Toast" game mode without them as an option.
